=Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Services Category=

There are three category of Cloud services, IaaS, PaaS and SaaS

=Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services=
There are 5 services of OCI Core Services:
1. Compute
OCI Compute Service consists of 5 components, namely bare metal, dedicated virtual hosts, 
virtual machines, container engines and functions. The more to the right then the less that needs to be 
addressed by the user.
-Bare Metal is a blank server so users have to handle virtualization, operating system, 
language runtime, app containers and code.
-Bare Metal server if you are going to do high intensity processing and handle 
a lot of I/O (Input and output) and require low latency.
-Bare Metal is perfect for web applications that require large computing resources,
or applications that process big data, processing 
that requires bring-your-own-licensing (BYOL).

=Compute -  Dedicated Virtual Host and Virtual Machines=
-Hosts is a single tenant model so no resources will be shared with other users 
and the virtualization layer is handled by Oracle
-The brown virtual machines service is a multitenant model with hypervisor-based virtualization.
On the VM there are sharing resources with other users 

*Examples of using VMs are: 
-Users want to set most of the operating system, such as OS Patch, security configuration, 
network, firewall, application configuration 
and manual or auto scaling to handle traffic needs. 
-Users want to use existing VM Images.
-Users want to migrate their own applications to OCI 

=Compute – Container Engine=
The service is a Container runtime environment that executes Containers and manages Container Images on nodes.

=Compute – Oracle Function=
-A service that allows users to simply write code.
-Users can write code in several languages without worrying about the 
infrastructure that has been handled by OCI.
-This service is called a serverless programming environment.

2. Storage
=Storage Model OCI=
Computing on applications requires storage with certain specifications. 
*The following is the OCI storage model, namely: 
-Supports persistent and non-persistent storage 
-Multiple formats such as structured, semi-structured and streaming data 
-High Performance Computing at a low cost 
-Data is protected against hardware damage 
-Data can be stored locally for personal use or remote storage for data sharing purposes 
-Data is accessed using a specific protocol 

=Storage Services=
There are 5 storage services supported by OCI, namely block volume, local NVME, 
file storage, object storage and archive storage.

3. Networking
-VCN is a network owned by your VM 
-VCN is an Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) service. 
-VCN allows users to manage existing networks in a cloud environment. In this case, 
we can set the IP Address, create subnets and route tables, also configure the firewall. 
-The benefits of Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) are: 
*To extend the local network to Oracle Cloud. 
*Improves security on VM networks. 
*Manage incoming and outgoing data traffic 

4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)
-IAM (Identity and Access Management ) lets you control who has access to the cloud resources you own, 
and what type of access they have, and to specific resources.
-IAM policies are documents that define who and how can be used to access resources.
-Group and compartment level access is granted, which means you can write policies that 
grant certain types of access within groups and use specific compartments.
-Compartment is a collection of interrelated resources that help you determine access to the resources you have.

5. Database Cloud Service
-Oracle is the only public cloud that supports VM database systems, 
offering extremely fast provisioning.
-OCI also supports bare metal database systems, which are extremely fast.
-OCI has a choice Oracle Cluster Databases, also known as Real Application Clusters, or RAC, have been 
the choice for managing high availability and performance for more than 20 years.
-OCI also offers the Exadata DB system, which offers extreme performance for both Online 
Transaction Processing (OLTP) and data warehouse applications.
-OCI's latest invention is an autonomous database.

The Autonomous database is built on Oracle's highly available Exadata architecture, 
so you can easily scale your database deployment.Some models of autonomous databases are Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), 
Autonomous Transaction Processing, (ATP) and Autonomous JSON.
-ATP is a cloud database service that removes the complexity of operating and securing high performance databases. 
ATP services are built to support everything from simple web applications to large, sophisticated applications that 
are critical to business operations.

-ADW is a Data Warehouse service that removes all the hassle of operating a Data Warehouse, 
securing data and developing data-driven applications. ADW includes tools for autonomous data loading, data transformation,
automatic insights, and machine learning analytics.
-The Oracle Autonomous JSON database is a document database that facilitates the development of JSON-centric applications. 
This service features a simple document API, serverless scaling, high performance asset transactions with comprehensive security.
