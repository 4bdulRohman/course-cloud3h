<H2>Cloud Computing is a general term used to describe a new class of network based computing that takes place over the Internet </H2>, <br> 
  basically a step on from Utility Computing <br>
  a collection/group of integrated and networked hardware, software and Internet infrastructure (called a platform). <br>
  Using the Internet for communication and transport provides hardware, software and networking services to clients <br>
  These platforms hide the complexity and details of the underlying infrastructure from users and applications by providing very simple graphical interface or API (Applications Programming Interface).<br>

<h2>A number of characteristics define cloud data, applications services and infrastructure: <h2> <br>
  Remotely hosted: Services or data are hosted on remote infrastructure. <br>
  Ubiquitous: Services or data are available from anywhere. <br>
  Commodified: The result is a utility computing model similar to traditional that of traditional utilities, like gas and electricity - you pay for what you would want <br>
 
<h2>Cloud Computing Characteristics </h2> <br>
  Massive Scale <br>
  Homogeneity <br>
  Virtualization <br>
  Low Cost Software <br>
  Resilient Computing <br>
  Geographic Distribution <br>
  Service Orientation <br>
  Advanced Security <br>

<h3>Cloud Service Models</h3> <br>
  Software as a Service (SaaS) <br>
  Platform as a Service (PaaS) <br>
  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) <br>

  
<h2>Basic Cloud Characteristics</h2> <br>
  The “no-need-to-know” in terms of the underlying details of infrastructure, applications interface with the infrastructure via the APIs.<br>
  The “flexibility and elasticity” allows these systems to scale up and down at will<br>
  utilising the resources of all kinds<br>
  CPU, storage, server capacity, load balancing, and databases <br>
  The “pay as much as used and needed” type of utility computing and the “always on!, anywhere and any place” type of network-based computing.<br>
