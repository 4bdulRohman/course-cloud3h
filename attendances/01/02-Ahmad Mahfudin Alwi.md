# Introduction

This first meeting includes an introduction, discussion of the material schedule for this semester, and a little overview of cloud computing.

Here is explained about the need for cloud computing and its uses and also how to use or create a VM (Virtual Machine).

Theritical Material

## Cloud Computing Environment

One of the digital transformation activities in the field of IT infrastructure, especially in IT infrastructure management is adaptation to the concept of cloud computing or cloud computing. Where what is different is the form of management, namely from ownership to asset rental.

Some of the global cloud computing service providers are Amazon Web Service (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle, Alibaba Cloud, IBM, Fujitsu and Huawei.

## There are 3 cloud service models, namely:

<ol>

<li> Cloud Computing Service Type: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) </li>

The type of cloud computing service Infrastructure as a Service or IaaS consists of the basic blocks for cloud IT. Generally, IaaS provides access to network features, virtual computers
as well as special hardware, and data storage space. With IaaS from cloud providers can flexibly control IT resources. This IaaS IT resource is the most similar to what developers and other people in the IT department usually encounter.

<li> Cloud Computing Service Model: Platform as a Service (PaaS) </li>

With the Platform as a Service or PaaS cloud computing service model, you can focus on application deployment and management. No need to manage infrastructure such as hardware and operating systems. Through this cloud computing service model, you can be even more efficient
because there is no need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, as well as software maintenance.

<li> Type of Cloud Computing Service: Software as a Service (SaaS) </li>

The third type of cloud computing service is SaaS or Software as a Service. SaaS is a form of complete cloud computing service, run and managed by the service provider. With SaaS, you don't have to think about how services are managed, or
how the infrastructure is managed. You just need to know how to use the software. In this course, an exploration of cloud computing services from providers will be carried out
Oracle Cloud computing. How cloud computing services from Oracle answer various infrastructure, architecture, and application deployment needs.
