#In Today's lesson we had an introduction for the class Cloud Computing. #Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, 
especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. #We should be familiar with VM and linux distros to start working on cloud computing.  
Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) 
to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, 
run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.
