<H1>1.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Service Categories </H1> <br>
In general, cloud computing services can be categorized into 3, such as: SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.<br>
<H1>2.Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services </H1><br>
OCI Core Services includes 5 things, such as: <br>
<h2>1. Compute</h2> <br>
OCI Compute Service consists of 5 components, namely bare metal, dedicated virtual hosts, virtual machines, container engines and functions. The further to the right the less the user needs to handle.Conversely, the more to the left, the more will be handled or managed by the user.<br>
<h2>2. Storage</h2> <br>
A. Storage Model <br>
Computing on applications requires storage with certain specifications. The following is the OCI storage model, <br>
B. Storage Services <br>
There are 5 storage services supported by OCI, namely block volume, local NVME, file storage, object storage and archive storage. <br>
<h2>3. Networking</h2> <br>
Oracle VCN stands for Virtual Cloud Network. VCN is an Infrastructures as a Service (IaaS) service. VCN is a network owned by your VM. VCN allows users to manage existing networks in a cloud environment. In this case, we can set the IP Address, create subnets and route tables, also configure the firewall.<br>
<h2>4. Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h2> <br>
Next, I'll cover OCI Identity and Access Management. OCI Identity and Access Management services can be abbreviated as IAM. IAM lets you control who has access to your cloud resources, and what type of access they have, and to specific resources.<br>
<h2>5. Database Cloud Service</h2> <br>
Next, we'll cover OCI Database Services. As we discussed, Oracle is the only public cloud that supports VM database systems, which offers extremely fast provisioning. OCI also supports bare metal database systems, which are extremely fast. <br>
