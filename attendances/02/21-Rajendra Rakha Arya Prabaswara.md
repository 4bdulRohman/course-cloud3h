### Week 2

1. Discussing Cloud Service Providers
2. Trying one of the Cloud Provider services namely OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure)
3. Assignment for students to try one of the services from OCI

### Many companies that provide cloud services include:

1. Amazon Web Services
2. Google Apps
3. Windows Azure
4. Oracle Cloud

**The above companies have used many of their services, ranging from IaaS to SaaS services, but as you should know, these services are expensive.Oracle cloud will be used in cloud computing lessons for one semester**

### Cloud Services

**On Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services**

**Levels on cloud-based services**
1. Saas (Software as a Service): Makes it easier to access applications without providing storage to save the application.
2. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service): A place to store which does not need maintenance so that it can focus on application development.
3. PaaS (Platform as a Service): A service that has a complete computing infrastructure.

**About Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Core Services**
1. Compute
- Compute - Bare Metal: In the form of a Blank server so that users have to handle virtualization, operating system, language runtime, app containers and code.
- Compute - Dedicated Virtual Hosts and Virtual Machines :Hosts are single tenant model so no resources will be shared with other users and the virtualization layer is handled by Oracle.
- Compute – Container Engine: Can setup app containers and application code.
- Compute – Oracle Function: A service that allows users to simply write code.
2. Storage
- Storage - Storage Model OCI: Requires storage with certain specifications.
- Storage – Storage Services: There are 5 storage services supported by OCI, namely block volume, local NVME, file storage, object storage and archive storage.
3. Networking: the components contained in the VCN are Subnets, Route Table, Security List, Internet Gateway, Nat Gateway, Service Gateway, Dynamic Router Gateway
4. Identity and Access Management (IAM): Can control access to cloud resources owned.
5. Database Cloud Service: The only public cloud that supports VM database systems by offering very fast provisioning.
