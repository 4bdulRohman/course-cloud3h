# Oracle Cloud Infrastructure instance types

<ol>

## <li>Bare Metal</li>

Bare metal are bare metal compute instances that give you access to dedicated physical servers for highest performance and robust isolation.

## <li>Virtual Machine (VM)</li>

VM is a virtual independent computing environment that runs on bare metal physical hardware. Virtualization makes it possible to run multiple VMs that are isolated from each other.

</ol>

# Shapes

Shapes is a template that defines the required amount of CPU, memory volume, and other resources allocated to a compute instance.

<ol>

## <li>Standard shapes</li>

designed for general needs that are widely used in applications and use cases in general.

## <li>DenseIO shapes</li>

designed for large databases, such as big data and applications that require high storage performance.

## <li>GPU shapes</li>

designed for hardware acceleration especially GPU needs including Intel, AMD CPUs and NVIDIA graphics processors.

## <li>High performance computing (HPC) shapes</li>

designed for high-performance computing that requires high frequency of processor cores and HPC in network clusters accessed in parallel.

## <li>Optimized shapes</li>

designed for high-level computing at processor core frequencies. This shape is also suitable for HPC needs with low latency. This shape also supports cluster networking.

</ol>

#### We also learned in todayâ€™s lesson that when creating a VM instance we can specify the CPU processor, the software image, how much computing power whither that would be adding more RAM or GPU.
