### Week 3's material is brief. 

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a sort of cloud service that is delivered in the form of software. 
Google Apps (Docs, Sheets, etc. ), Office 365, Creative Cloud, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure are all examples of SaaS.

Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Infrastructure provides bare metal and virtual machine (VM) instances. Bare Metal:

are bare metal compute instances that provide you with access to dedicated physical servers for maximum performance and isolation.
Virtual Machine: (VM) is a virtual independent computing environment that runs on bare metal physical hardware.

When creating a compute instance, you can select the appropriate type of instance based on resource characteristics such as 
the number of CPU cores required, the amount of memory, and network resources.

Types of shapes OCI offers a wide variety of shapes. • Standard shapes: designed for general needs that are widely used in applications and use cases in general. 
• DenseIO shapes: designed for large databases, such as big data and applications that require high storage performance 
• GPU shapes: designed for hardware acceleration especially GPU requirements 
• High performance computing (HPC) shapes: designed for high performance computing which require a high frequency of processor cores 
• Optimized shapes: designed for high-level computing at processor core frequencies.

Flexible shapes The types of flexible shapes available are: VM.Standard.E3.Flex (AMD) VM.Standard.E4.Flex (AMD) VM.Optimized3.Flex (Intel) VM.Standard.A1.Flex (Arm processor from Ampere )

Instance Types We can choose the capacity of each type of host used for the VM. On-demand capacity Preemptible capacity Reserved capacity Dedicated capacity.
