<h3>Types of Computes</h3>
<p>1. Bare Metal is a  computing instance that gives you access to a dedicated physical server for the highest performance and strong insulation.</p>
<p>2. Virtual Machine (VM) is a virtually independent computing environment that runs on bare metal physical hardware. Virtualization makes it possible to run multiple VMs that are isolated from each other.</p>

<h3>Types of Instances</h3>
<p>1. Shapes is a template that determines the cpu volume, memory volume, and other resources allocated to a compute instance. There are several types of Shapes, which are Standard shapes (for common use), DenseIO shapes (for big databases), GPU shapes (designed for hardware acceleration), HPC shapes (for high performance computation), and Optimized shapes (for high computation in core processor frequency)</p>
<p>2. Flexible shapes are templates that can custom a certain amount of OCPU and memory when launching or changing a VM. OCPU is equivalent to one physical core with simultaneous multithreading (hyper-threading), where each OCPU refers to two hardware that execute threads (also known as virtual CPUs or vCPUs). </p>

<h3>Types of Capacities</h3>
<p>You can choose the capacity of each type of host used for the VM. By default the on-demand type capacity has been selected, but it is also possible to choose other types of capacities.</p>
<p>1. On-demand capacity: just pay according to the compute capacity we use only. </p>
<p>2. Preemptible capacity: useful when requiring resources when workloads increase (autoscaling) in a certain period of time, making it more cost-effective. </p>
<p>3. Reserved capacity: useful spare capacity for the future according to needs. Unused spare capacity calculation of the cost is different from the resources that are being used.</p>
<p>4. Dedicated capacity: runs VM instances on a dedicated server, so that resources are not shared with other clients. </p>
