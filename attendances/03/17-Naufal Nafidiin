today lesson in cloud computing are

1. Create SSH Key
Before you start, you are going to need a key pair for authentication to your service.
$ ssh-keygen -b 2048 -t rsa -f myOracleCloudKey
$ chmod 600 myOracleCloudKey*
Enter and confirm the passphrase when prompted. You will be asked to upload the public key during the service creation.


2. Create a compute VM
Try one of service in the OCI compute service

3. Connecting to the VM using SSH
Connect to the "opc" operating system user by specifying your private key and the public IP address from your DB Systems page.

$ ssh -i ./myOracleCloudKey opc@123.123.123.123

[opc@obvm1 ~]$
Once connected, you can run commands using "sudo", or switch to "root".

[opc@obvm1 ~]$ sudo su -
[root@obvm1 ~]#

4. Configure HTTPS Access
If the VM is publicly accessible and you need HTTPS access configured, you can get certificates for free using Let's Encrypt and CertBot
