Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute. services Able to create Virtual Machine (VM) in Oracle Cloud compute service
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure offers 2 types of instances namely bare metal and virtual machine (VM): 
Bare Metal: compute instances that give you access to dedicated physical servers for the highest performance and robust isolation. 
Virtual Machine: computing environment that runs on bare metal physical hardware. Virtualization makes it possible to run multiple VMs that are isolated from each other.
We can select the appropriate instance type based on resource characteristics such as the number of CPU cores required, the amount of memory and network resources. 
VMs components
1.	Availability domain
2.	Virtual cloud network
3.	Key pair (For Linux)
4.	Tags
5.	Password (untuk Windows)
6.	Image
7.	Shape
We also learned in todayâ€™s lesson that when creating a VM instance we can specify the CPU processor, the software image, how much computing power whither that would be adding more RAM or GPU.
There are a lot of types for the components of a VM to choose from, we should go for the options that will satisfy our needs and meet our budget plan.
