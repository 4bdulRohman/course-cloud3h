In today's lessson we learend how to set-up a VCN Virtual Cloud Network in OCI Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) allows you to define your own data centre network topology inside the Oracle Cloud using a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
Cloud networks (VCNs) are private, customizable networks that you control. FastConnect, Site-to-Site VPN, and Edge Services let you securely connect your VCNs with other private or public networks.
VCN resides in a single Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region and includes one or more CIDR blocks (IPv4 and IPv6, if enabled).
Virtual Cloud Networks are virtual, private networks that you set up in Oracle data centers. It closely resembles a traditional network, with firewall rules and specific types of communication gateways that you can choose to use.
