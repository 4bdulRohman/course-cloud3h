PLATFORM AS A SERVICE (PAAS)
1.Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern
applications in the digital age—on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service.
2.Importance of Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS will provide:
• Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning on physical servers
• Highly optimized application for server ratios and the ability to turn off spare capacity
• Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting
• Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS . tenants
3.Services offered by PaaS
•	Artificial intelligence
•	Chatbots
•	Blockchain
•	Internet of Things (IoT)
4.Advantages of PaaS
The following are solutions that PaaS provides to meet each of these principles:
•	IT efficiency: PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability.
•	Business innovation: PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as for mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain) ), faster release cycles (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics).
•	Risk reduction: PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components. This can increase business resilience and reduce downtime while preventing data loss and speeding up recovery.
