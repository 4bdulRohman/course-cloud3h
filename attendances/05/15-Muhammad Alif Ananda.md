##TODAY LESSON - WEEK 5 ( SUMMARY )

Today Lesson is about PaaS


#What is PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service)?
PaaS, or Platform-as-a-Service, is a cloud computing model that provides customers a complete cloud platform—hardware, software, and infrastructure—for developing, running, and managing applications without the cost, complexity, and inflexibility that often comes with building and maintaining that platform on-premises.

The PaaS provider hosts everything—servers, networks, storage, operating system software, databases, development tools—at their data center. Typically customers can pay a fixed fee to provide a specified amount of resources for a specified number of users, or they can choose 'pay-as-you-go' pricing to pay only for the resources they use. Either option enables PaaS customers to build, test, deploy run, update and scale applications more quickly and inexpensively they could if they had to build out and manage their own on-premises platform.

Every leading cloud service provider—including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure—has its own PaaS offering. Popular PaaS solutions are also available as open source projects (e.g. Apache Stratos, Cloud Foundry) or from software ventors (e.g. Red Hat OpenShift and Salesforce Heroku).

#Benefits of PaaS

- Faster time to market. With PaaS, there’s no need to purchase and install the hardware and software you use to build and maintain your application development platform—and no need for development teams to wait while you do this. You simply tap into the cloud service provider’s PaaS to begin provisioning resources and developing immediately.

- Affordable access to a wider variety of resources. PaaS platforms typically offer access to a wider range of choices up and down the application stack— including operating systems, middleware, databases and development tools—than most organizations can practically or affordably maintain themselves. 
More freedom to experiment, with less risk. PaaS also lets you try or test new operating systems, languages and other tools without having to make substantial investments in them, or in the infrastructure required to run them.

- Easy, cost-effective scalability. With an on-premises platform, scaling is always expensive, often wasteful and sometimes inadequate: You have to purchase additional compute, storage and networking capacity in anticipation of traffic spikes; much of that capacity sits idle during low-traffic periods, and none of it can be increased in time to accommodate unanticipated surges. With PaaS, you can purchase additional capacity, and start using it immediately, whenever you need it.

- Greater flexibility for development teams. PaaS services provide a shared software development environment that allows development and operations teams access to all the tools they need, from any location with an internet connection.

- Lower costs overall. Clearly PaaS reduces costs by enabling an organization to avoid capital equipment expense associated with building and scaling an application platform. But PaaS also can also reduce or eliminate software licensing costs. And by handling patches, updates and other administrative tasks, PaaS can reduce your overall application management costs.
