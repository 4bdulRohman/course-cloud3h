Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a suite of services for building and managing modern 
applications in the digital age—on-premise or in the cloud. PaaS is a standardized, shared, and 
elastically scalable application development and deployment platform packaged as a service. These 
platforms typically include databases and middleware, as well as development, management, 
security, and integration capabilities, all delivered as a service.
PaaS is sometimes referred to as "Shared Services", where PaaS has the idea that each 
application requires some unique technology and a business cannot escape rigid deployment scenarios 
for packaged and custom applications.
To aid productivity, PaaS offers ready-to-use programming components that allow developers 
to build new capabilities into their applications, including innovative technologies such as artificial 
intelligence (AI), chatbots, blockchain, Internet of Things (IoT). 

Importance of Platform as a Service (PaaS) 
PaaS is an evolutionary approach to delivering the middleware and database capacity needed to host 
applications. When fully implemented, PaaS will provide:
• Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning on physical servers
• Highly optimized application for server ratios and the ability to turn off spare capacity
• Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting
• Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS .

Services offered by PaaS
• Artificial intelligence
AI which is artificial intelligence refers to systems or machines that imitate human intelligence to 
perform tasks and can iteratively improve themselves based on the information they collect. 
• Chatbots
A chatbot is a computer program that simulates and processes human conversations (whether written 
or spoken), enabling humans to interact with digital devices as if they were communicating with a 
real person.
• Blockchain
Blockchain is defined as a decentralized data ledger that is shared securely. Blockchain technology 
allows a select group of participants to share data.
• Internet of Things (IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) describes a network of physical objects—“Things”—embedded with 
sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with 
other devices and systems over the internet.

 Advantages of PaaS
Most IT decisions are justified based on three principles, namely efficiency, effectiveness and 
risk reduction. The following are solutions that PaaS provides to meet each of these principles:
• IT efficiency: PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes 
deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability.
• Business innovation: PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more 
responsive to business opportunities such as for mobile applications, support for more 
innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain) ), faster release 
cycles (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics).
• Risk reduction: PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates response to evolving 
threats across heterogeneous IT components. This can increase business resilience and reduce 
downtime while preventing data loss and speeding up recovery.
