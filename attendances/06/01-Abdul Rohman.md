<h2> The Advantages of Platform as a Service (Paas) </h2> <br>
The Goals of this summary : <br>
•	we can learn about PaaS services offered by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) <br>
•	we can take advantage of the PaaS services offered by Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) <br>
Most IT decisions are justified based on three principles, namely efficiency, effectiveness and <br>
risk reduction. The following are solutions that PaaS provides to meet each of these principles: <br>
1.	IT efficiency: PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes <br>
deployments, eliminates routine tasks, and improves scalability. <br>
2.	Business innovation: PaaS drives top- and bottom-line results by <br>
enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as for <br>
mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), <br>
more trusted transactions (blockchain) ), faster release cycles (containers <br>
and APIs), and data discovery (analytics). <br>
4.	Risk reduction: PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and accelerates <br>
response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components. This can <br>
increase business resilience and reduce downtime while preventing data <br>
loss and speeding up recovery.
