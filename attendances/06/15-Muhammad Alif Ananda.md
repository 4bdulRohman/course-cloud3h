##TODAY LESSON - WEEK 6 ( SUMMARY )

Today Lesson is about PaaS Part 2


#How does PaaS work?

As mentioned above, PaaS does not replace a company's entire IT infrastructure for software development. It is provided through a cloud service provider's hosted infrastructure. Users most frequently access the offerings through a web browser. PaaS can be delivered through public, private and hybrid clouds to deliver services such as application hosting and Java development.

Other PaaS services include:

Development team collaboration

Application design and development

Application testing and deployment

Web service integration

Information security

Database integration

Users will normally have to pay for PaaS on a per-use basis. However, some providers charge a flat monthly fee for access to the platform and its applications.

#What are the differences between PaaS, IaaS and SaaS?

PaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing services. The other two are software as a service (SaaS) and infrastructure as a service (IaaS).

With IaaS, a provider supplies the basic compute, storage and networking infrastructure along with the hypervisor -- the virtualization layer. Users must then create virtual machines, install operating systems, support applications and data, and handle all of the configuration and management associated with those tasks. Examples of IaaS services are DigitalOcean, AWS and Google Compute Engine (GCE).

With PaaS, a provider offers more of the application stack than IaaS solutions, adding operating systems, middleware (such as databases) and other runtimes into the cloud environment. PaaS products include AWS Elastic Beanstalk and Google App Engine.

With SaaS, a provider offers an entire application stack. Users simply log in and use the application that runs completely on the provider's infrastructure. Typically, SaaS applications are completely accessible via internet web browser. SaaS providers manage all IT resources. Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, Dropbox and Google Workspace.

#PaaS pros and cons

The principal benefit of PaaS is simplicity and convenience for users. The PaaS provider will supply much of the infrastructure and other IT services, which users can access anywhere through a web browser. The ability to pay on a per-use basis allows enterprises to eliminate the capital expenses they traditionally have for on-premises hardware and software.

Service availability or resilience, however, can be a concern with PaaS. If a provider experiences a service outage or other infrastructure disruption, this can adversely affect customers and result in costly lapses of productivity. However, PaaS providers will normally offer relatively high uptimes.

Vendor lock-in is another common concern because users cannot easily migrate many of the services and data from one PaaS product to another competing product. Users must evaluate the business risks of service downtime and vendor lock-in when they select a PaaS provider.

Internal changes to a PaaS product are also a potential issue. For example, if a PaaS provider stops supporting a certain programming language or opts to use a different set of development tools, the impact on users can be difficult and disruptive. Users must follow the PaaS provider's service roadmap to understand how the provider's plan will affect their environment and capabilities.

Many PaaS products are geared toward software development. These platforms offer compute and storage infrastructures, as well as text editing, version management, compiling and testing services that help developers create new software quickly and efficiently. A PaaS product can also enable development teams to collaborate and work together, regardless of their physical location.
