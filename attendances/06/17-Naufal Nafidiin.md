What is PaaS?
PaaS (Platform as a Service) is a Cloud service that is provided in the form of a platform and can be used by users to build applications on it. PaaS provides a framework for developers that they can build on and use to build customized applications.

When you use the Saas model, all servers, storage and network are managed by the company or third party provider. However, developers can manage application management.
