Platform as a Service (PaaS)
Platform as a Service (PaaS) is a set of services for building and managing modern applications in the digital ageâ€”on-premise or in the cloud. 

## The Importance of Platform as a Service (PaaS)
PaaS is an evolutionary approach to delivering middleware and database capacity required to host the application. When fully implemented, PaaS will give:
- Fast (near real time) capacity provisioning against physical servers
- Highly optimized app for server ratio and ability to shut down
spare capacity
- Proactive cross-domain monitoring and alerting
- Measurement facility to set usage parameters for PaaS . tenants

## Benefits of PaaS
- <b>IT efficiency</b> <br>
PaaS accelerates provisioning, improves automation, standardizes deployment, eliminating routine tasks, and increasing scalability.
- <b>Business innovation </b> <br> PaaS drives top- & bottom-line results by enabling IT to be more responsive to business opportunities such as mobile applications, support for more innovative user experiences (chatbots), more trusted transactions (blockchain), faster release cycles (containers and APIs), and data discovery (analytics).
- <b>Risk reduction </b> <br> PaaS strengthens and simplifies security and speeds up response to evolving threats across heterogeneous IT components. This matter can increase business resilience and reduce downtime while preventing data loss and speed up recovery.
