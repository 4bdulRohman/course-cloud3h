# Software as a Service (SaaS)
Software as a service, is a cloud-based software service model in which a cloud provider develops and maintains cloud application software, provides automatic software updates, and makes software available to its customers over the internet with a pay-as-you-go service concept. So SaaS customers can lower the cost of developing a service and improve business solutions faster than maintaining their own systems and devices, and customers can predict the total cost of services with greater accuracy.

## Benefits of SaaS for Business
In recent years, many software vendors have been aggressively promoting cloud-based services, especially targeting IT professionals and business people. In a promotion targeting business players, vendors emphasize the advantages of using cloud services on operating costs with capital expenditures. SaaS is not a new concept. Web-based applications created by application service providers actually existed before the concept of computing as we know it today.
- Lower up-front costs, eliminating the need for additional hardware and middleware and reducing installation and implementation costs.
- Predictable ongoing costs, eliminating unexpected changes to managing software and hardware

- On-demand scalability, can be scaled instantly to maintain service levels.
